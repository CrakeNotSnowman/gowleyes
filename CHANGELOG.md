> “What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.

> “About what?” He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.

> “About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They’re real.”

> “The books?”

> He nodded.

> “Absolutely real — have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real. Pages and — Here! Lemme show you.”

> Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the “Stoddard Lectures.”

> “See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop, too — didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”

#### Big Picture: What happened, what was worked on

A large portion of this project was outlined. Then I got overwhelmend by how big it had grown so quickly compared to how nothing worked, and stopped working on it. Then I cam back to it, ignored everythin else prior, and restarted from square 1, and made an ugly bodge. Now it's ugly and easily broken, but I get an ebook on my ereader, and that's better than it was before. 

This version has one bodge pipeline, no handling of error conditions, poor documentation. But it works, and that'll motivate me to do it right (or at least better) going forward. 

#### Added
 - LaTex to html
 - Bodge Arxiv-Vanity Pipeline: Taking in a URL, it'll run until an ebook is sent to my kindle start to finish. It's ugly, there's a block of 10 seconds where I can't touch the keyboard/mouse, and so much of it is hard coded. But it works, and it'll be something to improve going forward.
#### Changed
#### Deprecated
#### Removed
#### Fixed
#### Security
#### Documentation
 - That's a good idea. 
#### Testing
 - Some tests exist. They're 'alright' but not where I'd like them to be.
